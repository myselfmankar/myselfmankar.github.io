Good. Now we switch mindset.

College placements ≠ Startup GenAI hiring.

For placements, recruiters care about:

* Strong fundamentals
* Clear internship
* 2–3 solid projects
* Achievements
* Clean formatting
* Not too “startup AI niche”

We make you look:

> Strong Computer Engineering student with AI + backend exposure.

Not:

> Hyper-niche GenAI infra engineer.

Below is your **college placement optimized resume content**.

This is clean, structured, safe for mass recruiters, product companies, and even service companies.
