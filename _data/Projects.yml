  - title: "[AI Architecture Diagram Generator](https://github.com/myselfmankar/architecture-gen)"
    description:
      - "**Stack**: Python (FastAPI), LangChain, Gemini AI, Rust, Mermaid.js"
      - Engineered an AI-powered tool that reduces architecture diagram creation time from **2-3 hours to 60 seconds**, automating icon search, layout generation, and validation.
      - Implemented self-healing validation pipeline with LangChain structured outputs, achieving **99% first-generation success rate** through automated syntax repair.
      - Designed dual-mode architecture (post-processing + LLM tool calling) enabling both deterministic reliability and experimental agentic workflows.

  - title: "[Icon Search Engine](https://github.com/myselfmankar/icon-search)"
    description:
      - "**Stack**: Rust, CLI tooling"
      - Built a custom Rust search engine that fuzzy-matches **3,600+ icons in <100ms**, eliminating 45 minutes of manual icon hunting per diagram.
      - Implemented deterministic ranking algorithm with name normalization for reliable automation and LLM integration.
      - Designed for developer tooling with JSON output mode for seamless integration into AI-assisted workflows.

  - title: "[Digital Asset Management System](https://myselfmankar.github.io/digital-asset-mangement)"
    description:
      - "**Stack**: Python (FastAPI), SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL"
      - Designed a metadata-driven image storage and retrieval system using **PostgreSQL**, enabling indexed queries by attributes such as location and category.
      - Implemented a clean backend API with **FastAPI** and **SQLAlchemy**, focusing on extensibility and maintainability.
