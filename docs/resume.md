## Experience

### Software Engineering Intern & Team Lead – Visualization
**Across The Globe** | Aug 2025 – Present | Remote

- **Performance Optimization**: Reduced Slide Creation Node (SCN) execution time by **~30%** by introducing **parallel processing (3–5 slides concurrently)** within an AI-driven content generation pipeline on **AWS Lambda**, improving throughput.
- **Reliability Engineering**: Owned and stabilised a core visualization pipeline component used across the platform, improving reliability and maintainability of production workflows.
- **Backend Architecture**: Designed routing logic to dynamically select cloud execution paths based on course metadata and programming language, improving scalability.
- **Tooling**: Built internal developer-facing tools to automate content workflows, including a **Markdown-to-PDF documentation generator** used by the product team.
- **Leadership**: Led a visualization sub-team of **2 interns**, owning task breakdown, reviewing implementations, and unblocking production issues.

## Projects

### Content Automation Pipeline
**Stack**: Python, Langchain, Gemini AI

- Built an automated pipeline that ingests source content, applies structured transformations, and persists results using a relational database.
- Designed with a human-in-the-loop approval flow to balance automation and correctness.
- Reduced manual content preparation effort by up to **70%**.

### Digital Asset Management System
**Stack**: Python (FastAPI), SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL

- Designed a metadata-driven image storage and retrieval system using **PostgreSQL**, enabling indexed queries by attributes such as location and category.
- Implemented a clean backend API with **FastAPI** and **SQLAlchemy**, focusing on extensibility and maintainability.

### WhatsApp Chat Analytics
**Stack**: Python, Streamlit, Pandas

- Built a data processing pipeline to convert raw chat logs into structured datasets for analysis and visualisation.
- Delivered insights through a Streamlit dashboard, reducing analysis time from hours to minutes.
